<h2>Student | Journalist | Photographer</h2>
<img src="img/headshot.jpg" width="45%" alt="Kelsey Grentzer headshot"/>
<p> My name is Kelsey Grentzer, and I'm a fourth-year journalism and sustainability student at the University of Florida with experience in reporting, photography, videography, copy editing and marketing.</p>

<p>My writing and photography have been published in <em>The Gainesville Sun, The Independent Florida Alligator, INsite Magazine, The Fine Print, The Suncoast News</em> and other publications.</p>

<p>I have always had a meticulous sense for grammar and spelling, a natural curiosity and a creative eye for photography, and I love using these skills to learn and share others' stories.  Some of my special interests include travel, nature and environmental issues.</p> </p></body></article>
